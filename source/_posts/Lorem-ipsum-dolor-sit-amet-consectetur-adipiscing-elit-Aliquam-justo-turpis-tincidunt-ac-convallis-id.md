# Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Shut up and take my money! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. __Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.__ *Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep!* And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

## Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Okay, I like a challenge. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

1. Who am I making this out to?
2. You are the last hope of the universe.
3. No, I'm Santa Claus!

### Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

* Your best is an idiot!
* Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
* You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Why would a robot need to drink? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! No. We're on the top. I never loved you.

Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

You're going to do his laundry? Ooh, name it after me! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Professor, make a woman out of me. Soon enough. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Shut up and take my money! When will that be? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

Moving along… Actually, that's still true. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

When will that be? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Noooooo! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Who are you, my warranty?! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
