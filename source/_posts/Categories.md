# I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. You hit me with a cricket bat. __You hit me with a cricket bat.__ *Aw, you're all Mr.* Grumpy Face today.

## No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

1. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
